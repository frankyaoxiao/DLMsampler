# Analysis Directory

This directory contains analysis scripts and results for SEFM (Soft-Embedding Flow-Matching) development.

## Structure

- `lipschitz_analysis/` - Lipschitz analysis of LLaDA models for ODE solver validation
- Other analysis scripts as needed for SEFM research

## Important Note

Analysis scripts were temporarily removed but this directory structure preserves the organization for future analysis work on SEFM.
